# Task Index — Top Dog

> **Milestone status:** `pending` (stub — not yet exploded) | `active` (exploded, in progress) | `deferred` (parked — body preserved) | `complete`
> **Task status (inside milestone files):** `pending` | `in_progress` | `blocked` | `complete`
> **Priority key:** `P0` (critical) | `P1` (high) | `P2` (medium) | `P3` (low)
> **Size key:** `S` (< 1 hour) | `M` (1-4 hours) | `L` (4+ hours)
> See [[PROJECT]] for architecture decisions and [[CLAUDE]] for conventions.

## How this works

- Each milestone has its own file under `tasks/` holding its tasks in full detail.
- Future milestones live here as **one-line stubs** until activated. Only the
  **planner** explodes a stub into its milestone file (never the director or
  other agents).
- Completed tasks stay in their milestone file. When a milestone closes, that
  frozen file is the milestone's permanent archive — there is no separate archive
  for new milestones. The pre-migration milestones (M0, M1) are grandfathered in
  [[TASKS-ARCHIVE]].
- Two cross-milestone logs: [[tasks/deferred]] and [[tasks/discovered]].

## Active Milestones

**No active milestone.** **Milestone M7 — Safety & Polish completed 2026-06-18** (all 6
tasks; tag `milestone-07-safety-polish`) — see § Completed Milestones. With it, **all
pre-specified plenary milestones (M0–M7) are complete.** Future work is tracked in
[[tasks/discovered]] and would open a new milestone (planner-exploded on user
activation).

> **Open ops action (user):** the two M7 migrations
> (`20260617205453_burger_alarms.sql`, `20260618120000_burger_verdicts.sql`) still need a
> hosted `supabase db push` before the report→verdict flow works on hosted. No
> keep-alive / auto-pause risk (no scheduled job touches these tables).

## Planned Milestones

These milestones were pre-specified by the project's initial plenary, so they
carry **full task files now** rather than header-only stubs. (The new-model
default is a one-line stub the planner explodes on activation; here the detail
was already written, so it is preserved.) Depends-on is kept coarse.

None — M7 (the last pre-specified milestone) is now **complete**. Future work is tracked
in [[tasks/discovered]] and feeds any post-M7 milestone stubs.

## Deferred Milestones

None.

## Logs

- [[tasks/deferred]] — task-level deferred / descoped work, with disposition
  (whole-milestone deferral lives in § Deferred Milestones above)
- [[tasks/discovered]] — discovered-work log (feeds future milestone stubs)
