# Task Index — Top Dog

> **Milestone status:** `pending` (stub — not yet exploded) | `active` (exploded, in progress) | `deferred` (parked — body preserved) | `complete`
> **Task status (inside milestone files):** `pending` | `in_progress` | `blocked` | `complete`
> **Priority key:** `P0` (critical) | `P1` (high) | `P2` (medium) | `P3` (low)
> **Size key:** `S` (< 1 hour) | `M` (1-4 hours) | `L` (4+ hours)
> See [[PROJECT]] for architecture decisions and [[CLAUDE]] for conventions.

## How this works

- Each milestone has its own file under `tasks/` holding its tasks in full detail.
- Future milestones live here as **one-line stubs** until activated. Only the
  **planner** explodes a stub into its milestone file (never the director or
  other agents).
- Completed tasks stay in their milestone file. When a milestone closes, that
  frozen file is the milestone's permanent archive — there is no separate archive
  for new milestones. The pre-migration milestones (M0, M1) are grandfathered in
  [[TASKS-ARCHIVE]].
- Two cross-milestone logs: [[tasks/deferred]] and [[tasks/discovered]].

## Active Milestones

**No milestone is currently `active`.** **Milestone M5 — Walls & DMs completed**
2026-06-17 (TASK-050/051/052/053; tag `milestone-05-walls-dms`) — message walls +
direct messages, plus a mid-milestone **grants hotfix** (TASK-052/053) that restored
the explicit Data API grants after the Supabase CLI `auto_expose_new_tables` default
flip (2026-05-30) and pinned the config so local matches cloud. **TASK-054 (push the
M5 migrations + grant fix to hosted)** was deferred to [[tasks/deferred]] as a
user-gated ops follow-up. The next planned milestone is **M6 — Emoji Library**
(pre-exploded, ready to activate — see § Planned Milestones). See § Completed
Milestones for M5 and the prior milestones.

## Planned Milestones

These milestones were pre-specified by the project's initial plenary, so they
carry **full task files now** rather than header-only stubs. (The new-model
default is a one-line stub the planner explodes on activation; here the detail
was already written, so it is preserved.) Depends-on is kept coarse.

## Logs

- [[tasks/deferred]] — task-level deferred / descoped work, with disposition
  (whole-milestone deferral lives in § Deferred Milestones above)
- [[tasks/discovered]] — discovered-work log (feeds future milestone stubs)
